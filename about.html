        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Ian Simpson was born in San Diego and grew up in North County San Diego (760 area code). His family is mostly secular in practice
            so he did not have a strong connection to any culture or belief growing up. Throughout schooltime he tried different pursuits,
            but none seemed to stick. This led to a sense of being lost and to a certain extent despair. Alongside failure in school, family
            issues, and a relatively weak body, he found this sense overwhelming. When looking for role models he saw society looks up to 
            those that seem superficially happy and carefree(bums). So his pursuits took a further downturn. After he caused himself many
            problems, he finally got the idea that he was looking for purpose in the wrong place. Along the way, some talents were gifted
            to him. So, he saw life looking up, and investigated self-help, philosophy, and trades. However, it was still missing something
            and that something felt very significant. One day in community college philosophy class the professor introduced an idea 
            that if the atheists are Heaven forbid right and everything is completely physical and secular, then there would still be
            no downside to following a religion and believing in something. However, if a religion is right and one does not follow it
            there would be a serious problem. Therefore, Ian started to investigate more seriously the far eastern religions that were
            popular in the San Diego region due to its "surfer/hippy" scene(bums). He found no strong connection to these to say the least
            and continued with an agnostic/self-help mindset. After a while he finished quite a few of his books and saw he had on the shelf
            a new international version bible that his grandmother sent him. So, he thought he will give it a try. He started in the first
            pages, as one does with other books, and found himself in an albeit badly translated and almost illegible version of the Holy
            Sefer Beresheet. He learned about Adam, Eve, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, The Twelve Tribes, and many other significant figures.
            As he learned he felt an immense connection to the historical, geographical, and scientific proofs; realistic and powerful
            stories; and awesome beauty of the Holy Torah. Continuing through the Five Books of Moses, he encountered the mighty verses
            that could not be hampered by the poor translation and lack of commentary.
            <h3>Exodus 20:</h3>
            1God spoke all these words, saying:	 	
            אוַיְדַבֵּ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֔ים אֵ֛ת כָּל־הַדְּבָרִ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה לֵאמֹֽר:
            2"I am the Lord, your God, Who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.	 	
            באָֽנֹכִ֨י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֽוֹצֵאתִ֩יךָ֩ מֵאֶ֨רֶץ מִצְרַ֜יִם מִבֵּ֣ית עֲבָדִ֗ים:
            3You shall not have the gods of others in My presence.	 	
            גלֹ֣א יִֽהְיֶ֣ה־לְךָ֩ אֱלֹהִ֨ים אֲחֵרִ֜ים עַל־פָּנַ֗י:
            4You shall not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness which is in the heavens above, 
            which is on the earth below, or which is in the water beneath the earth.	 	
            דלֹ֣א תַֽעֲשֶׂה־לְּךָ֣ פֶ֣סֶל | וְכָל־תְּמוּנָ֡ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּשָּׁמַ֣יִם | מִמַּ֡עַל וַֽאֲשֶׁר֩ בָּאָ֨רֶץ מִתַּ֜חַת וַֽאֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּמַּ֣יִם | מִתַּ֣חַת לָאָ֗רֶץ:
            5You shall neither prostrate yourself before them nor worship them, for I, the Lord, your God, am a zealous God, 
            Who visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third and the fourth generation of those who hate Me,
            הלֹֽא־תִשְׁתַּֽחֲוֶ֣ה לָהֶם֘ וְלֹ֣א תָֽעָבְדֵם֒ כִּ֣י אָֽנֹכִ֞י יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֨יךָ֙ אֵ֣ל קַנָּ֔א פֹּ֠קֵ֠ד עֲוֹ֨ן אָבֹ֧ת עַל־בָּנִ֛ים עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁ֥ים וְעַל־רִבֵּעִ֖ים לְשֽׂנְאָ֑י:
            6and [I] perform loving kindness to thousands [of generations], to those who love Me and to those who keep My commandments.
        	ווְעֹ֤שֶׂה חֶ֨סֶד֙ לַֽאֲלָפִ֔ים לְאֹֽהֲבַ֖י וּלְשֹֽׁמְרֵ֥י מִצְוֹתָֽי:
            <h3>Numbers 23:</h3>
            19God is not a man that He should lie, nor a son of man that He should reconsider. 
            Would He say something and not do it? Would He speak and not fulfill what He said?	 	
            יטלֹ֣א אִ֥ישׁ אֵל֙ וִֽיכַזֵּ֔ב וּבֶן־אָדָ֖ם וְיִתְנֶחָ֑ם הַה֤וּא אָמַר֙ וְלֹ֣א יַֽעֲשֶׂ֔ה וְדִבֶּ֖ר וְלֹ֥א יְקִימֶֽנָּה:
            20 I (Bilam) have received an instruction to bless them(the Jews); He (HASHEM) has blessed, and I cannot retract it.
    	 	כהִנֵּ֥ה בָרֵ֖ךְ לָקָ֑חְתִּי וּבֵרֵ֖ךְ וְלֹ֥א אֲשִׁיבֶֽנָּה:
            21I have looked and not found any idolaters in Jacob, nor any dishonest workers in Israel. 
            HASHEM, their God, is with them, and they retain the King’s friendship.	
         	כאלֹֽא־הִבִּ֥יט אָ֨וֶן֙ בְּיַֽעֲקֹ֔ב וְלֹֽא־רָאָ֥ה עָמָ֖ל בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהָיו֙ עִמּ֔וֹ וּתְרוּעַ֥ת מֶ֖לֶךְ בּֽוֹ:
            <h3>Hear, O Israel, HASHEM is our G‑d, HASHEM is One.
                שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד׃</h3>
            <h3>Deuteronomy 33:</h3>
            10There never arose another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom HASHEM knew face to face,	 	
            יוְלֹא־קָ֨ם נָבִ֥יא ע֛וֹד בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל כְּמשֶׁ֑ה אֲשֶׁר֙ יְדָע֣וֹ יְהֹוָ֔ה פָּנִ֖ים אֶל־פָּנִֽים:
            <h3>Exodus 31:</h3>
            12HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying:	 
        	יבוַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־משֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר:
            13"And you, speak to the children of Israel and say: 'Only keep My Sabbaths! 
            For it is a sign between Me and you for your generations, to know that I, the HASHEM, make you holy.
            יגוְאַתָּ֞ה דַּבֵּ֨ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר אַ֥ךְ אֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֖י תִּשְׁמֹ֑רוּ כִּי֩ א֨וֹת הִ֜וא בֵּינִ֤י וּבֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ לְדֹרֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם לָדַ֕עַת כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה מְקַדִּשְׁכֶֽם:
            14Therefore, keep the Sabbath, for it is a sacred thing for you. 
            Those who desecrate it shall be put to death, for whoever performs work on it, 
            that soul will be cut off from the midst of its people.
    	 	ידוּשְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֔ת כִּ֛י קֹ֥דֶשׁ הִ֖וא לָכֶ֑ם מְחַֽלֲלֶ֨יהָ֙ מ֣וֹת יוּמָ֔ת כִּ֗י כָּל־הָֽעֹשֶׂ֥ה בָהּ֙ מְלָאכָ֔ה וְנִכְרְתָ֛ה הַנֶּ֥פֶשׁ הַהִ֖וא מִקֶּ֥רֶב עַמֶּֽיהָ:
            15Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, 
            holy to HASHEM; whoever performs work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.'	 	
            טושֵׁ֣שֶׁת יָמִים֘ יֵֽעָשֶׂ֣ה מְלָאכָה֒ וּבַיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֗י שַׁבַּ֧ת שַׁבָּת֛וֹן קֹ֖דֶשׁ לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה כָּל־הָֽעֹשֶׂ֧ה מְלָאכָ֛ה בְּי֥וֹם הַשַּׁבָּ֖ת מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת:
            16Thus shall the children of Israel observe the Sabbath, to make the Sabbath throughout their generations
             as an everlasting covenant.	 	
             טזוְשָֽׁמְר֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֑ת לַֽעֲשׂ֧וֹת אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֛ת לְדֹֽרֹתָ֖ם בְּרִ֥ית עוֹלָֽם:
            17Between Me and the children of Israel, it is forever a sign 
            that [in] six days THASHEM created the heaven and the earth, and on the seventh day He ceased and rested."	 	
            יזבֵּינִ֗י וּבֵין֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל א֥וֹת הִ֖וא לְעֹלָ֑ם כִּי־שֵׁ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים עָשָׂ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־הַשָּׁמַ֣יִם וְאֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ וּבַיּוֹם֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י שָׁבַ֖ת וַיִּנָּפַֽשׁ:

            However, Ian didn't know what a Jew was or even what each religion believed in. After a course of roughly
            another year he investigated scriptural and philosophical sources of the three main religions in the world
            and came to the conclusion that only Orthodox Judaism contains the Truth. He discovered Rabbis Yosef Mizrahi,
            Yaron Reuven, and Yehoshua Zitron. Through their lectures based on scientific and logical proofs his choice 
            was constantly reaffirmed. After about 2 more years he discovered Rabbi Lev Leib Lerner and continues to learn
            from these wonderful teachers. He hopes to move to a Haredi community and become Jewish himself.
            Each day is a blessing and we cannot thank HASHEM enough for the kindness, truth, and mercy that He has done 
            with us.

        </h2>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Music was one of Ian's first passions and he spent much time listening to a variety growing up. In high school,
            Ian learned basics of guitar, as well as electronic music with FL Studio. In Senior year, Ian released an album
            featuring his hip-hop inspired beats. As he discovered the Holy Torah, music has taken on a different role in His
            life. He now understands that music is a powerful vessel meant for the service of G-d and not for things that
            are contrary to that goal.
